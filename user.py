User are created in the server application. They are managed by Room entity.
The usersâ€™ identification is usernames, every user is REQUIRED to provide a username.
Users entities also have information about their sockets (addresses and socket
objects). The Users entity manages a list of the id of rooms that this user is in.
The list will be used to check if users have the ability to send messages in a room.
The Clients will communicate with Server using IP and Port numbers through User
entities. The data structure of the list of room id is dictionary because we need
to access to find the room id very often.
